## Introduction

The present documents intends to describe the Human Task Specification.

The specification is intended to be a modernization of the (awesome) [WS-HumanTask Specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bpel4people/ws-humantask-1.1-spec-cs-01.html).

## Core concepts

### Generic Human Roles

Generic human roles define what a person or a group of people resulting from a people query can do with tasks and notifications. The following generic human roles are taken into account in this specification:

- [Potential initiators](#potential-initiators)
- [Initiator](#initiator)
- [Stakeholders](#stakeholers)
- [Potential owners](#potential-owners)
- [Actual owner](#actual-owner)
- [Excluded owners](#excluded-owners)
- [Business administrators](#business-administrators)
- [Notification recipients]()

#### Potential initiators

##### Description

Defines the potential initiators of the task.

***Remark(s)**: Implementations should allow users to instanciate the tasks they are the potential initiators of.*

##### Permissions

- [x] Instanciate task.
- [x] Patch input data *(only before task has been claimed)*.
- [x] Add attachment *(only before task has been claimed)*.
- [x] Add comment *(only before task has been claimed)*.

#### Initiator

##### Description

Represents the person that has initiated (instanciated) the task.

##### Permissions

- [x] Patch input data *(only before task has been claimed)*.
- [x] Change priority *(only before task has been claimed)*.
- [x] Add attachment *(only before task has been claimed)*.
- [x] Add comment *(only before task has been claimed)*.

#### Stakeholders

##### Description

Defines the people ultimately responsible for the oversight and outcome of the task. A task stakeholder can influence the progress of a task, for example, by adding ad-hoc attachments, forwarding the task, or simply observing the state changes of the task.  It is also allowed to perform administrative actions on the task instance and associated notification(s), such as resolving missed deadlines.

##### Permissions

- [x] Add/remove attachment.
- [x] Add comment.
- [x] Receive notifications.
- [x] Patch input/output data.
- [x] Forward task.
- [x] Revoke task.
- [x] Change priority.

#### Potential owners

##### Description

Defines the persons who receive the task so that they can claim and complete it. A potential owner becomes the actual owner of a task by explicitly claiming it. Before the task has been claimed, potential owners can influence the progress of the task, for example by changing the priority of the task, adding ad-hoc attachments or comments.

##### Permissions

- [x] Claim task.
- [x] Change priority *(only before task has been claimed)*.
- [x] Add attachment *(only before task has been claimed)*.
- [x] Add comment *(only before task has been claimed)*.

#### Actual owner

##### Description

An actual owner of a task is the person actually performing the task. When task is performed, the actual owner can execute actions, such as revoking the claim, forwarding the task, suspending and resuming the task execution or changing the priority of the task.

##### Permissions

- [x] Revoke task.
- [x] Skip task. 
- [x] Delegate/forward task.
- [x] Suspend task.
- [x] Resume task. 
- [x] Change priority.
- [x] Add attachment.
- [x] Add comment.

#### Excluded owners

##### Description

Defines the users that are excluded from performing (and otherwise know/do anything about) the task.

##### Permissions

None.

#### Business administrators

##### Description

Business administrators play the same role as task stakeholders but at task definition level. Therefore, business administrators can perform the exact same operations as task stakeholders. Business administrators can also observe the progress of notifications.

##### Permissions

- [x] Add/remove attachment.
- [x] Add comment.
- [x] Receive notifications.
- [x] Patch input/output data.
- [x] Forward task.
- [x] Revoke task.
- [x] Change priority.
- [x] Edit task definition.

#### Notification recipients

##### Description

Defines the people who receive notifications about the user task's status.

##### Permissions

- [x] Receive notifications.

### Lifecycle

#### Instanciation

Once created, a [human task definition](#human-task-definition) needs to be instanciated, which can be done in various ways:

- `Periodically`, by defining a [schedule](#schedule-definition), in which case the [task](#human-task-definition) will be instanciated at configured intervals.
- `Manually`, in which case the [task](#human-task-definition) is explicitly instanciated by a [potential initiator](#potential-initiators).
- `Asynchronously`, in which case the [task](#human-task-definition) is instanciated by a consumed [`HumanTaskCreationRequested` integration event](#human-task-creation-requested-integration-event).
- `Implicitly`, in which case the [task](#human-task-definition) is instanciated by another [task](#human-task-definition), for example as the result of an [escalation](#deadlines-and-escalations).  

#### Task instance statuses

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| `created` | The [task](#human-tasks) has been created. <br>It should automatically move to the `ready` status, save if the [potential owners](#potential-owners) query did not resolve a single user.<br>In that case, a [business administrator](#business-administrator) of the task is expected to explicitly assign the [task](#human-tasks).|
| `ready` | The [task](#human-tasks) can be claimed by one of its [potential owners](#potential-owners).  |
| `reserved` | The [task](#human-tasks) is assigned to a single person or has been claimed by one of its [potential owners](#potential-owners).<br>The [actual owner](#actual-owner) of a [task](#human-tasks) can choose to release it and make it again available to its [potential owners](#potential-owners). |
| `running` | The [task](#human-tasks) has started and is in progress. |
| `completed` | The [task](#human-tasks) has been completed. |
| `obsolete` | The [task](#human-tasks) is obsolete and has been skipped. |

#### Task instance flow

```

### Runtime expressions

#### Description

The specification defines expressions that can be used to select, filter, alter and create task-related data based on the [operational context](#operational-context).

By convention, <ins>all runtime expressions should be expressed using the `${ expression }` format</ins>, even as values of properties that explicitly expect a runtime expression. 
This allows readers of an authored [definition](#human-task-definitions) to easily identify them.

Because of its countless features, we chose to use [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) as the spec's default runtime expression language, which by the way is a minimal requirement for implementations.

#### Examples

*Example of a [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) expression used to interpolate a greeting message with the [actual owner](#actual-owner)'s name:*

```yaml
Hello ${ $CONTEXT.peopleAssignments.actualOwner.name }! How are you today?
```

*Example of a [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) expression used to merge the task's input data and the form's data:*

```yaml
$CONTEXT.inputData + $CONTEXT.form.data
```

*Example of a [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) condition used to check if an hypothetical customer passed as the task's input is an adult:*
```yaml
${ (((now | todate)[0:4] | tonumber) - ($CONTEXT.inputData.customer.dateOfBirth[0:4] | tonumber)) >= 18 }
```

### Task Instance Data

Task instances have access to 3 types of data:

- [Input Data](#input-data): The task's input data.
- [Form Data](#form-data): The task's form data, filled by owners.
- [Output Data](#input-data): The task's output data.

The data is exposed to [runtime expressions](#runtime-expressions) by the [runtime context data](#runtime-context-data), using the `$CONTEXT` argument, which is described [here](#runtime-context-data).

#### Input Data

##### Introduction

The business data passed as the task's input. 

It may or may not be, partially or not, related to the data of the task's form submitted by users. Equally, it may or may not be, partially or not, related to the task's output data.

The data is validated against the [JsonSchema](https://json-schema.org/) specified as the `inputDataSchema` property of the [task's definition](#human-task-definitions), if any.

Note that the input data should be presented in a human-readable way (avoid machine formats such as `json`) to users performing the task. 

##### Examples

```yaml
client:
  id: 123
  firstName: Larry
  lastName: Queen
  dateOfBirth: '03/22/1969'
request:
  concerns: debit-card
  requestType: order
  parameters:
    originatesFrom:
      type: agency
      name: OpenBank Zimbabwe
      address: 69 Love Street, 1969 Harare, Zimbabwe
    deliverTo:
      type: agency
      name: OpenBank Zimbabwe
      address: 69 Love Street, 1969 Harare, Zimbabwe
    observations: none
```

#### Form Data

##### Introduction

Represents the form data submitted by task owners.

##### Examples

```yaml
requestReviewed: true
requestOutcome: accepted
confidenceRatio: 0.92
observations: None
```

#### Output Data

##### Introduction

The task's business data output.

The data is validated against the [JsonSchema](https://json-schema.org/) specified as the `outputDataSchema` property of the [task's definition](#human-task-definitions), if any.

##### Examples

```yaml
client:
  id: 123
  firstName: Larry
  lastName: Queen
  dateOfBirth: '03/22/1969'
request:
  createdAt: 02/02/2022, 14:55:51 +01:00
  concerns: debit-card
  requestType: order
  parameters:
    originatesFrom:
      type: agency
      name: OpenBank Zimbabwe
      address: 69 Love Street, 00000 Harare, Zimbabwe
    deliverTo:
      type: agency
      name: OpenBank Zimbabwe
      address: 69 Love Street, 00000 Harare, Zimbabwe
    observations: none
result:
  type: success
  status: inProgress
  scheduledDate: 02/07/2022
```

#### Runtime Context Data

##### Introduction

The `$CONTEXT` [runtime expression](#runtime-expressions) argument exposes operational data, such as both the task's input and output data, its form, its comments, its attachments, etc.

Note that exposed data is processed and arranged before making it available.

##### Properties

| Name | Type | Description | 
|------|:----:|-------------|
| id | `string` | The task instance's unique identifier. |
| key | `string` | The task instance's key. |
| definitionId | `string` | The unique identifier of the [task's definition](#human-task-definitions). |
| status | `enum` | The task instance's [status](#task-statuses). |
| priority | `number` | The task instance's priority. |
| title | `object` | The mappings of localized titles to their two-letter **ISO 639-1** language names. |
| subject | `object` | The mappings of localized subjects to their two-letter **ISO 639-1** language names. |
| description | `object` | The mappings of localized descriptions to their two-letter **ISO 639-1** language names. |
| peopleAssginments | [`peopleAssignments`](#people-assignments-definitions) | Describes the people related to the task and their assigned role(s). |
| inputData | `object` | The task instance's input data. |
| outputData | `object` | The task instance's output data. |
| form | [`form`](#forms) | The task's form. |
| comments | [`comment[]`](#comments) | An array containing the task's comments. |
| attachments | [`attachment`](#attachments) | An array containg the task's attachments. |

##### Examples

*For example, if a [task's definition](#human-task-definitions) declares a subject such as the following:*

```yaml
...
subject:
  en: 'OpenBank Memo - ${ $CONTEXT.inputData.department.name.en } Department'
...
```

*... and if it is instanciated with an input data such as the following:*

```yaml
department:
  id: 123
  name:
    en: 'Credits and Loans'
```

*The following data would be made available in the `$CONTEXT` argument:*

```yaml
...
subject:
  en: 'OpenBank Memo - Credits and Loans Department'
...
```

*Example of a [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) condition that checks whether or not the task's instance's `priority` is higher than or equals 10:*

```jq
$CONTEXT.priority >= 10
```

### Deadlines and escalations

[Deadlines](#deadline-definitions) define a point in time at which a human task must have reached a specific status. If it did not, a set of [action](#escalation-action-definitions) are performed as part of conditonal [escalations](#escalation-definitions).

There are two kind of [deadlines](#deadline-definitions):

- `start`: Specifies the time until the task has to start, i.e. it has to reach state `inProgress`. It is defined as either the period of time or the point in time until the task has to reach state `inProgress`. 
Since expressions are allowed, durations and deadlines can be calculated at runtime, which for example enables custom calendar integration. The time starts to be measured from the time at which the task enters the state `created`. If the task does not reach state `inProgress` by the deadline an [escalation action](#escalation-action-definitions) or a set of [escalation actions](#escalation-action-definitions) is performed. Once the task is started, the timer becomes obsolete.

- `completion`: Specifies the due time of the task. It is defined as either the period of time until the task gets due or the point in time when the task gets due. The time starts to be measured from the time at which the task enters the state Created. If the task does not reach one of the final states (`completed`, `failed`, `error`, `exited`, `obsolete`) by the deadline an [escalation action](#escalation-action-definitions) or a set of [escalation actions](#escalation-action-definitions) is performed.

When a [deadline](#deadline-definitions) is reached, its [escaltions](#escalation-definitions) are evaluated to determine whether or not they should be performed. If an [escalations](#escalation-definitions) matches, the [action](#escalation-action-definitions) it defines is performed.

There are 3 types of [escalation actions](#escalation-action-definitions):

- [`notification`](#notification-escalation-action-definitions): Creates a new instance of the specified [notification definition](#notification-definitions) and adds to the work item queue of the specified recipients.
- [`reassignment`](#reassignment-escalation-action-definitions): Reassigns the task to another person and/or group of people.
- [`subtask`](#subtask-escalation-action-definitions): Creates a new subtask as the result of the escalation.

An example deadline use case would be to notify the actual owner that the task is past due after 1 hours if it has not been completed. Here is how to do this:

```yaml
...
deadlines:
  - name: start-before-1h
    type: completion
    duration: PT1H
    escalations:
      - name: reminder
        action:
          notification:
            refName: please-resolve-urgently
...
```

### Notifications

[Notifications](#notification-definitions) are used to communicate the progress of a task to one or more recipients. 

Like [forms](#form-definitions), [notifications](#notification-definitions) define a [view](#view-definitions) that specifies how to render them.

### View Definitions

#### Description

Represents the definition of a view.

Views can be rendered using different modes. Note that multiple modes can be combined in a comma-separated way (ex: "process, render").

- `process`: Default rendering mode. The raw template is pre-processed in search of runtime expressions it interpolates after evaluation.
- `render`: The template should is pre-rendered by the server before being served to consumers.
- `none`: The template is not processed nor rendered, and is given as such to consumers.

#### Properties

|------|:----:|:--------:|:---------------------:|-------------|
| type | `string` | `yes` | `yes` | The view type.<br>*Defaults to [`gfm`(GitHub Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/).*<br>*Can be a [runtime expression](#runtime-expression).* |
| renderingMode | `enum` | `yes` | `no` | Defaults to `process`. Indicates the way the view should be rendered.<br>Possible values are: `process`, `render` and `none`. |
| template | `string`<br>`object` | `yes` | `yes` | The view template.<br>*If a `string`, the raw template contents.*<br>*If an `object`, the inline template.*<br>*Can be a (or contain) [runtime expression(s)](#runtime-expression).* |
