# Human Task Specification

## About

The Open Human Task (OHT) declares a vendor-neutral, open-source, free and community-driven specification for defining, running and managing Domain Specific Language (DSL) based human interactions with modern software ecosystems. 

The Open Human Task DSL is heavily based on the (awesome) [WS-Human Task Specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bpel4people/ws-humantask-1.1-spec-cs-01.html), which it intends to be a modernization of.

The project is composed of:

- [Specification]() to define and document the OHT DSL.
- [Software Development Kits (SDKs)]() to read, write, parse and validate `Human Task Definitions` in multiple languages.
- [Runtimes](): to manage, serve, render and execute `Human Task Definitions`.
